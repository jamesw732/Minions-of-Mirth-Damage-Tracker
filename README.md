# Minions of Mirth Reborn DPS Calc
This program records real-time data on the damage dealt by a given player and uses solely the state of the game log file (client\logs\game.txt file). This file is updated once a certain number of lines have been sent to the game window, I believe it's around 10 lines, and upon each game log update, more damage data is collected. This approach is probably the only one that a third-party program will be able to achieve, however there are some limitations and nuances to it that will be important to understand in order to use this program properly.
# How To Use
## Downloading and Running
There are a few ways of getting this program onto your local machine. One is to simply download files from the repo - either DamageTracker.exe alone or every .py file would suffice, but Github also lets you download the whole repo as a .zip, which you can extract anywhere. However, I instead recommend cloning the whole repo (`git clone https://github.com/jamesw732/Minions-of-Mirth-Damage-Tracker.git`), as this will let you call `git pull` on the commandline in the repo instead of having to redownload the files every time I push a change. You do not need to put the files in any specific location (such as your client's directory), this program should work from anywhere. However, the python files must stay together in the same directory, as well as any files created by the program (just damagedata.txt and settings.json I think).  
In either case, you may run the program either by running main.py, which requires Python, or by running DamageTracker.exe, which doesn't require Python but has a slight startup time. If you trust the code but not the exe (technically you have no reason to trust the exe), you can build it with the command `pyinstaller -F -n DamageTracker --noconsole main.py`. You'll want to move it out of the dist folder, though.
## Configuring and Saving Settings
Whichever method you choose to download and run this program, once you're in the GUI, you'll have to put some information in the three left-most columns:
1. The name(s) of the character or mob which you wish to track the damage of. If multiple names are entered, then they must be separated by a comma and space. Example: `Flake, Soulgazer`.
2. The path to the relevant `game.txt` file, select this with the file dialog that pops up. The location of this file will be inside your client's folder (something like `client/logs/game.txt`).
3. The third entry labeled "Threshold" establishes a time threshold (in seconds) such that if the time between two hits by the tracked player is greater than that threshold, then the damage tracking resets. This is desirable because long waits between fights typically make data over that time period uninteresting. If we reset, then there's at least a chance that we get interesting data. By default, this is 10 seconds, and if you wish to disable it, simply input a large number.
Once you have configured your desired settings, click "Save Settings" to save them. You can save multiple presets and change which one you're using whenever you like using the "Presets" dropdown. You can also delete the current preset using the "Delete Preset" button.
## Tracking Damage
The rest should be pretty intuitive once you have the settings configured. "Start" begins a new damage tracking period, and "Stop" stops it. It will be obvious that you started tracking because a "Tracking DPS" indicator will replace the "Not Tracking" one and data cells will start to populate with numbers. Clicking "Save Data" will write the current contents of those data cells, including the name, to a local file called `damagedata.txt`. Minimal formatting is done here, just the name and the values of each of the data fields separated by a space. I may get around to improving this eventually.
### Notes on Use
- The elapsed time is based on the difference in time between your first tracked hit and your last tracked hit, NOT real time since pressing the start button.
- The accuracy of the program is pretty dependent on the rate of lines entering the game window. The more lines per second, the more accurate the game log is to the actual state of the game, and thus the input to the program is more accurate at real time.
- On the other hand, the combat channel can get turned off magically, and I'm not certain how. I think it is caused by either camping or having too many lines get sent through the game window. This makes it difficult to accurately track multiple players over a long boss fight.
- A common problem is that you kill a mob but there are a few lines of damage that didn't go through. If you care enough to get the complete damage data, pop a couple /who's or something before you stop tracking and this should force a game.txt update, and your damage/time data will be preserved perfectly, as if captured in real time. An alternative may be to keep tracking until the next log update, but I think it's okay as is.
- Log files are unique to the client you're using, independent of the world. This means that if you want to track damage data in single player, just use the same log file that you were using for the server. It also means that if you log into the same account on two different clients, you will have to manually replace your chosen log file.
- The min hit and avg hit stats are a little bit useless since kicks and archery will skew these values. But still, I figure there's no point in excluding them. It's probably better and more visually appealing than unused space, anyways.
- If you are tracking for more than one character/mob, the inactivity timer is independent for each one.
- You can edit your inputs while the tracker is running, and your changes won't be loaded until you press the "Start" button again.
### (Potential) Limitations/Bugs
- After some high amount of lines (18,000 or something), game.txt turns into game.txt.1, and any existing game.txt.1 turns into game.txt.2, etc, and game.txt resets to a blank test file. This will only be an issue for damage tracking very rarely, however I did add handling that *I believe* works. I did not test it by capturing a game.txt rollover in the wild, instead I fabricated the rollover behavior, however it's possible that I'm wrong and did not do this perfectly, but I'm fairly confident that any issue witht this would be small and go unnoticed.
- An unavoidable problem is that mobs with the same name all count towards the same damage source in the tracker. This isn't an issue for tracking multiple players, but it is if you're tracking your enemies and you're fighting multiple mobs with the same names.
- In any case, if you notice any bugs or have suggested improvements, whether mentioned here or not, let me know!
